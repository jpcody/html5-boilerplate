## General project notes

## To Do

Place items that you're trying to remember to do here. Probably better to use your project management tool of choice, but I always end up having this anyways.

## Instructions for launch

Place anything like instructions for combining or minifying code or things to be aware of.

## Launch Checklist

Make sure each of these are performed before a launch. Use the following format to indicate when a task was completed. And mark the appropriate time it was completed (or the relevant code commit) and any notes you might have.
