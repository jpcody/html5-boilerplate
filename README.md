#  Joshua Cody's HTML5 Boilerplate [http://html5boilerplate.com](http://html5boilerplate.com) Fork

See the [official project's README](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/README.md) for version-by-version information.

## Why the fork?

This is the specific boilerplate that I use to start my projects. It uses [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS, contains a checklist/notes file to ensure smooth launches and clear communication, and gets rid of some things that were cruft as far as I was concerned (Boilerplate touch icons and favicon, QUnit as I'm planning to use [Jasmine](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery), and some commenting I found unnecessary).

## Contributors and Thanks

This is from the original project, not this fork, but I thought it'd be a shame to give them any less credit than deserved. And of course, huge thanks to Paul Irish for making the boilerplate a reality.
